# Experiments of Master Thesis at NYCU

## Functionality
### distribution_generator.y
Generate wanted distributions

### pcap_generator.cpp, analyzer.ipynb, analyzer.py
Generate pcaps according to the above distributions
- analyzer.ipynb, analyzer.py
It's too slow to generation pcaps efficiently
- pcap_generator.cpp
It's written from python to cpp
Recommend to use cpp version only

### plot.py
Plot the generated pcaps for validation
